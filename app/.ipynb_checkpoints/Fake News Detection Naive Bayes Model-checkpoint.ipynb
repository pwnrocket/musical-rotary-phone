       "' Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion InvestigationHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.'"

The research was conducted by the university's department of community health sciences (CHS) by carrying out an online survey of 373 respondents between April and May. The study’s first phase used validated screening tools to determine if people had generalised anxiety disorder.  More than 90% of the participants were from Sindh and Punjab in the research.\"Respondents ranked the top three causes of anxiety and stress as being fear of contracting the virus, financial losses during the pandemic and losing a loved one to COVID-19,\" said the press release. The study found that survey participants were much more concerned about their loved ones catching the disease with nearly eight out of ten respondents, or 76%, feeling a lot of fear or extreme fear of those close to them falling ill. In contrast, four of ten respondents, or 36%, reported a lot of fear or extreme fear about catching the virus themselves. “The pandemic has exposed our social and economic vulnerabilities and created widespread uncertainty in society,” said Professor Sameen Siddiqi, the CHS department chair. “If left unchecked, stress associated with COVID-19 can lead to distress and the distress can lead to disease.” Those already suffering from anxiety and stress are especially vulnerable to advanced illnesses such as depression and other mental health disorders, added Maryam Lakhdir, the study’s principal investigator and a senior instructor in the CHS department. “The findings suggest that we are at risk of a mental health crisis during a pandemic. Policymakers must prioritise psychosocial interventions to limit the chances of long-lasting scars on our mental health,” Lakhdir said.\"\"\"]"

The court asked where in the minutes of the meeting was such material mentioned.The court asked PTA if it would shut down everything if the CPO were to ask it to. \"Which complaint mentioned that the game is against Islamic teachings,\" asked the court.At this, the PTA lawyer stated that the situation had unfolded such that the game had to be suspended.You have to take decisions according to the law not the situation, remarked Justice Farooq. There are other games as well which are perhaps even more violent, he observed.On July 1, the PTA suspended PUBG after \"receiving complaints from different segments of society\".\"PTA has received numerous complaints against PUBG wherein it is stated that the game is addictive, waste of time and poses serious negative impact on physical and psychological health of the children,\" a statement by the authority said.The court had sought records pertaining to the ban from the authority at the previous hearing.\"\"\"]"
